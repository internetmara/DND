          <h2 class="about-description2"><i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.
          D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game
          industry. D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play. These
          characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon (DM) serves as the game's referee and
          storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the
          game world. The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they
          solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn
          experience points (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming
          sessions. This generator was made to assist the DM in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs), environments, monsters to
          encounter, locations to frequent and magic items to find in the course of their adventures.</h2>
